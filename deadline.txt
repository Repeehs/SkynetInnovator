Report:
D1 - development of basic cloud infrastructure and databse: 27/3/2025 (3:00 p.m) - 10%
D2 - Enhancement of Cloud 
Infrastructure and Deployment of an Application: 14/4/2025 (3:00 p.m) - 60%
Reassessment: 28/4/2025 (3:00 p.m)

Report requirements - Minimal Requirements of the Application (D1):
• Must use a database. 
• Must include a client (can be a browser or a mobile app) 
• Must use a server accepting requests from the client. 
• Should use static objects such as images. 

The deployment of the application in the cloud should consider the following requirements (D1):
• The application must be highly available by using AWS services (e.g. 2x servers in 
different Availability Zones and ELB) 
• Setup users and roles (where possible) 
• Design/define secure VPCs (use of subnets private and public). 
• It should be noted that 
PaaS infrastructure such as Elastic Beanstalk must not be used in this project. 
• Ensure application security by using good security groups/settings.  
• Use a database with redundancy. 
• Design security, monitoring, and logging (cloud trail, cloud watch) 
• Use of content distribution of static objects (e.g., images) 
• Use of S3

The report for this deliverable (D2) should further contain the followings:
• Description of every step in the design, development and deployment of the 
application supported by evidence (e.g., screenshots) 
	o Make sure that your group number is reflected in the name of any AWS feature/services that you have created in your project. For example, if you 
have created an ELB and your group number is 3, then you may name your ELB as Group3_ELB. This is a mandatory requirement and if it is not followed for any AWS service/feature in your project then you may not get any mark for that AWS service/feature. 
• A cost breakdown that covers the current scenarios of the application and then 
forecast different load scenarios. 
• Test cases (with test results documented) 
• A discussion on the security approach and demonstrating best-practices. 
• A theoretical discussion of future enhancements and other cloud features that 
could be used.
